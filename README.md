# AI-Driven Model Simulations for Resource Optimization in Circular Economy

This project investigates the application of AI algorithms to optimize resource allocation, demand-supply matching, and dynamic pricing within a circular economy digital marketplace. Using various machine learning and reinforcement learning models, the project explores strategies to improve resource efficiency and support sustainable urban development.

## Project Description

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different model simulations for optimizing resource flows. Each notebook addresses a unique model, such as ARIMA, LSTM, Q-Learning, and more, applied to synthetic datasets designed to mimic real-world market conditions.

## Features

- **Input Data Characterization**: Analyzes and characterizes input data, preparing it for model simulations.
- **Model Simulations**: Includes time-series, machine learning, and reinforcement learning models to handle forecasting and optimization tasks.
- **Pricing Optimization**: Implements Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning models for adaptive pricing strategies.
- **Waste Generation and Economic Growth Modeling**: Analyzes the impact of waste and economic growth variables on resource management.

## Requirements

The project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

jupyter notebook


Open and run any of the .ipynb files in the notebooks/ directory to simulate the respective models.

Notes
The project uses synthetic data; however, you can replace it with real-world data by placing your data files in the data/input/ folder and modifying the notebooks to load your dataset.
For pricing optimization, run the 09_Q_Learning_Pricing_Optimization.ipynb and 10_Deep_Q_Learning_Pricing_Optimization.ipynb notebooks to experiment with Q-Learning-based strategies.
